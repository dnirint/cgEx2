Part 1 Question 6:
The function MakeFlatShaded makes flat shading because the norm of each vertex is now determined by only 
one norm - the unique triangle it belongs to. When "Is Flat Shaded" is unchecked, each vertex belongs to 
more than one face and therefore its norm is an average of several triangles.
